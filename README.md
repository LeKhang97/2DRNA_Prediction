# RNA2DPred
## Description
Respiratory for the prediction of RNA 2D structure using integer programming
RNA2DPred is a Python-based program to predict RNA secondary structure using either energy-based method (MFE), probability-based method (MEA), pattern matching method or 2 of them together (bi-objective optimization).

The main file for structure prediction is RNA2DPred.py, but the other file motif_alignment.py can be run independently as an alignment tool.
